- I made this app for Mobile app developer programme at Nackademin,Sweden  and Intro to iOS App Development with Swift lesson of Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree course. 
-  The app allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with four different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Slow, Fast with Reverb and Echo effect.
